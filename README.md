## About listFul

  [listFul](https://lisamsmith100.github.io/listFul/) lets users generate a list. The list can be created, edited, or deleted from the browser and all actions need to be authenticated.

  listFul is built using javascript, Handlebars, HTML, and CSS and relies on a Rails API/Postgres to persist data. Code for that API can be found at lisamsmith100/listFul-rails-api](<https://github.com/lisamsmith100/listFul-rails-api>).

  ## Development Process

  Originally, I set out to create a list templating app using Ember and Rails.
  After spending nearly 20 hours trying with Ember, and in agreement with a consultant
  in switching gears if not comfortable enough, I decided to pursue the Browser
  Template avenue.

  I had high hopes of making something lovely but, downgraded the plans for this
  projet due to the lack of time and the issue queue items holding the project up.

  In the end, I ended with a far smaller subset of what I had set out to accomplish
  but the ability to create, read, and update stand, with a structure differet than
  what I have done in the recent deade.

  I began with a high level plan and continued to whittle down to daily tasks.
  Throughout the process, I felt immense pressure to try something new.  I
  tried Ember and I feel good that I learned quite a bit about full stack
  application development.
